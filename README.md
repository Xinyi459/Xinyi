# Collision detection between sphere and triangle mesh
We have completed two algorithms for collision detection. 
The first method is to detect the collision of each sphere against each triangular mesh, which is and really slow. 
The second method is much better, we used an octree algorithm. 
In this case, we donâ€™t need to consider all the spheres and meshes since most of them are too far apart to contact with each other.

## Install 
Set your own path in main.c and use gcc to generate executable file.
Make sure you include all function files whose header files are mentioned.
