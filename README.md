# Collision detection between sphere and triangle mesh
We have completed two algorithms for collision detection. 

The first method is to detect the collision of each sphere against each triangular mesh, which is and really slow. 

The second method is implemented using binary tree. Stack is added to simulate recursive traversal. 


## Install 
For method 1,
Set your own path in main.c and use gcc to generate executable file.
Make sure you include all function files whose header files are mentioned.

For method 2,
Main funcition is in BVTreeCollisionDetection.c
Use cmake to build the code. Input files should be in the same directory with executable, or you can change path in main function
