Main function is BVTreeCollisionDetection.c
This function uses bouncing volumn tree to detection collision between triangle mesh and sphere

Use camke to build the code.
Due to some problem, this program can handle all data (16301 triangle and 10000 sphere) only in windows.
                     In linux, the input data should no more than 16384 (This is about 1820 triangle).
